# Collaboration Project

In this project, in collaboration with a classmate from BeCode, Philemon (GitHub: https://github.com/PhilemonPhilippin), we created a website where we display movies sourced from a public API. The application allows users to apply various filters, such as viewing the latest movies or performing a keyword search.
