# Collaboration Project

In this project, in collaboration with a classmate from BeCode, Philemon (GitHub: [PhilemonPhilippin](https://github.com/PhilemonPhilippin)), we created a website where we display movies sourced from a public [API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). The application allows users to apply various filters, such as viewing the latest movies or performing a keyword search.
