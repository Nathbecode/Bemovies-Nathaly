# Collaboration Bemovies Project

## Overview
This project is a **movie website** built to demonstrate the integration of **React.js** and **TMDB API** (The Movie Database API). The primary goal is to showcase dynamic fetching and rendering of movie data, along with clean design and smooth user interactions. It allows users to browse popular movies, search for specific titles, and view detailed information about each film.

## Features
- **Home Page:** Displays popular movies fetched from TMDB API.
- **Movie Search Functionality:** Allows users to search for specific movies by title.
- **Movie Details Page:** Provides detailed information about a selected movie, including the title, description, rating, release date, and more.
- **Responsive Design:** The web app is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Error Handling:** Displays user-friendly error messages if a movie search yields no results or if thereâ€™s an issue with fetching data.
- **Loader Component:** Shows a loading spinner while data is being fetched.
- **Styled Components:** Uses **Styled-Components** to manage styling within the React components, promoting modular and reusable styles.
  
## Technology Used
- **React.js:** The project is built with React.js to manage the component-based architecture and dynamic rendering of movie data.
- **TMDB API:** The app uses The Movie Database API to fetch movie data dynamically.
- **Styled Components:** CSS-in-JS styling solution for building reusable and modular CSS within components.
- **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the TMDB API and handling responses.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Used throughout for logic, API calls, and handling user interaction.
- **Consuming APIs**

  ## Limitations
- **Static API Key:** The current version uses a hardcoded API key. For better security, consider storing the API key securely in a backend or using environment variables with more robust protection.
- **No Backend:** This project focuses only on the frontend and API interaction. There's no backend for authentication or storing user data.
